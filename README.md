## **Topics Covered**

### 1. **CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy)**
CMA-ES is a black-box optimization algorithm widely used in reinforcement learning and evolutionary strategies. It focuses on optimizing non-linear, non-convex functions by iteratively updating a distribution of candidate solutions based on covariance matrix adaptation.

### 2. **Imitation Learning**
This module involves learning to mimic expert behavior. The following subtopics are covered:
- **Regression for Behavior Cloning**: Learning policies through supervised learning by regressing on expert trajectories.
- **DAgger (Dataset Aggregation)**: A policy improvement method to reduce compounding errors in imitation learning.
- **Diffusion Policy**: Leveraging diffusion models for learning robust and flexible policies.
